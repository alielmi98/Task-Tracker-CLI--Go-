# Task Tracker CLI (Go)
 This Go project implements a command-line interface (CLI) for managing tasks. Features include adding, updating, deleting, and listing tasks, with filtering by status (todo, in-progress, done). The application stores data in a local JSON file. This project is a solution to the Task Tracker challenge on roadmap.sh.
